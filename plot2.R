# Rev. Info: 1.0 - initial version of the script
# 
# This script generates a plot of total PM25 emissions in Baltimore City in years
# 1999-2008.
# Base grapics system is used.
# Original data is available at: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2FNEI_data.zip
# More information about data: http://www.epa.gov/ttn/chief/eiinformation.html
# 
#     Input: summarySCC_PM25.rds file located in the current working directory
#    Output: plot2.png written to the current working directory
# Execution: source(plot2.R)
# 
# Prerequisites: 1) this script and the data files are located in the current
#                   working directory
#                2) dplyr package is installed

# Calculate total emissions levels in Baltimore City for each year
baltpmtot <- pm %>% filter(fips == BaltimoreFips) %>% group_by(year) %>% summarise(Emissions = sum(Emissions))

# Plot the emissions levels vs. year along with the linear regression line
#
# Design decision: As PM25 emissions can be cotrolled only "approximately"
# (due to high number of influencing factors) as a user of this grpah I'd be 
# more interested in the trend over years rather than in the exact shape of
# the emissions curve. Hence the yearly emisions are marked as points 
# and a trend line (linear regression) is added. This kind of plot allows to
# answer the question if the total emissions in Baltimore City decreased
# between 1999 and 2008 (compare extreme point values) and provides additional
# information if the overall trend is also decreasing.
