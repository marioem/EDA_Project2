#    Author: Mariusz Musia≈Ç
# Rev. Info: 1.0.0 - initial version of the script
#            1.1.0 - changed combined plot to 2x2 faceted plot
# 
# This script generates a plot of PM25 emissions in Baltimore City in years
# 1999-2008 split between source types.
# ggplot2 grapics system is used.
# Original data is available at: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2FNEI_data.zip
# More information about data: http://www.epa.gov/ttn/chief/eiinformation.html
# 
#     Input: summarySCC_PM25.rds file located in the current working directory
#    Output: plot3.png written to the current working directory
# Execution: source(plot3.R)
# 
# Prerequisites: 1) this script and the data files are located in the current
#                   working directory
#                2) dplyr package is installed
#                3) ggplot2 package is installed

# Calculate emissions levels in Baltimore City for each year for each of 4 types
baltpmtype <- pm %>% filter(fips == BaltimoreFips) %>% group_by(type, year) %>% summarise(Emissions = sum(Emissions))

# Plot the emissions levels vs. year along with the linear regression line
#
# Design decision: As PM25 emissions can be cotrolled only "approximately"
# (due to high number of influencing factors) as a user of this grpah I'd be 
# more interested in the trend over years rather than in the exact shape of
# the emissions curve. Hence the yearly emisions are marked as points 
# and a trend line (linear regression) is added.
# In order to ease the analysis of each type of emission a plot with 4 facets
# with free y axis has been chosen. The answer to the question if the emission
# level for each type decreased or increased between 1999 and 2008 in Baltimore
# City can thus be easier spotted.

## Without faceting horizontal reference lines can be added on the height of first
## and last point for each emission type to ease a bit checking if the emission
## level between first and last analyzed year increased and decreased.
## For faceting plot it is not so easy to separate each pair of lines between each
## facet, so I'll leave it for another day.
