#    Author: Mariusz Musia≈Ç
# Rev. Info: 1.0.0 - initial version of the script
# 
# This script generates a plot of PM25 motor vehicle-related emissions in
# Baltimore City and LA County in years 1999-2008. For detailed discussion
# of data selection and presentation see comments in the code.
# ggplot2 grapics system is used.
# Original data is available at: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2FNEI_data.zip
# More information about data: http://www.epa.gov/ttn/chief/eiinformation.html
# 
#     Input: summarySCC_PM25.rds, Source_Classification_Code.rds files located
#            in the current working directory
#    Output: plot6.png written to the current working directory
# Execution: source(plot6.R)
# 
# Prerequisites: 1) this script and the data files are located in the current
#                   working directory
#                2) dplyr package is installed
#                3) ggplot2 package is installed

# Data selection decision:
# For the present analysis a "motor vehicle" is deemed a mobile source which is
# descibed as a bus, truck, vehicle or a motorcycle, powered by either diesel or 
# gasoline fuel.
# Excluded are therefore aircrafts, vessels, construction equipment, agriculture
# or garden equipment, etc. Excluded are also emissions not related to motor
# fuel combustion, e.g. dust emitted from paved/unpaved roads, etc.
# This decision is based on the assumption that because the area of interest in
# Question 5 is an urban area, the interpretation of "motor vehicle" is that of
# a motor-powered vehicle used for any kind of road transportation.
# This decision led to the selection of SCC codes which describe "Mobile Sources"
# on Level One and bus or vehicle or truck or motorcycle on Level Three.
# (This selection leads basically to Level Two Highway Vehicles without
# LevelThree "NOT USED - Previously all LDGT (1&2) under M5" group).

# Calculate total coal combustion-related emissions per measurement year
# Some of the SCC codes bear notion of "Total" or "All" (those ending with "000").
# This suggests that it can be some kind of subsum. A random check of a certain
# series didn't confirm this, so for the purpose of this assignment I assume it
# is OK to sum over SCCs without excluding suspected subsums.

# Question 6 is related to the change over the years and its comparision between
# LA and Baltimore county. Hence we anchor plots for both counties on the relative
# emission level of 0 tons in 1999. Let's do the level shift in a simple way:

center <- c(rep(motorvehi$Emissions[1],4), rep(motorvehi$Emissions[5],4))
motorvehi$Emissions <- motorvehi$Emissions - center

# Plot semi-normalized emissions levels vs. year
#
# Design decision: In order to compare the changes in emissions between the two
# locations a composite line plot was chosen. Relative data anchored at 0 tons
# emission in 1999 is plotted.
