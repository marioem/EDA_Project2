#      Date: 2015.09.21
#    Author: Mariusz Musia≈Ç
# Rev. Info: 1.0.0 - initial version of the script
# 
# This script generates a plot of PM25 emissions in US related to coal combustion
# related sources, in years 1999-2008.
# ggplot2 grapics system is used.
# Original data is available at: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2FNEI_data.zip
# More information about data: http://www.epa.gov/ttn/chief/eiinformation.html
# 
#     Input: summarySCC_PM25.rds, Source_Classification_Code.rds files located
#            in the current working directory
#    Output: plot4.png written to the current working directory
# Execution: source(plot4.R)
# 
# Prerequisites: 1) this script and the data files are located in the current
#                   working directory
#                2) dplyr package is installed
#                3) ggplot2 package is installed

# Coal combustion related data are identified based on SCC codes for which variable

# Then theis conjunction is used to subset scc dataframe.

# Calculate total coal combustion-related emissions per measurement year
# Some of the SCC codes bear notion of "Total" or "All" (those ending with "000").
# This suggests that it can be some kind of subsum. A random check of a certain
# series didn't confirm this, so for the purpose of this assignment I assume it
# is OK to sum over SCCs without excluding suspected subsums.

# Plot the emissions levels vs. year along with the linear regression line
#
# Design decision: In order to support the answer to the question *how* emission
# changed a line graph option was chosen.
